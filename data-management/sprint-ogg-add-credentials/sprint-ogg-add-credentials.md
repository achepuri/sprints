# How do I add database credentials by using the Oracle GoldenGate Admin client?


## Connect to the Administration Service from the Admin Client and add database credentials

Learn how to add the database credentials to connect to the source and target databases from the Administration Service.

1. Ensure that you have the appropriate database privileges to be able to execute the commands in the Admin Client.

2. To open the Admin Client, run the following script: 
    ```
    <copy>
        adminclient

    </copy> 

    ```
    

    **Note**: You donâ€™t need to navigate to the *OGG_HOME/bin*  directory to run the Admin Client each time. The PATH environment variable is set for this. This is a client-server connection.

3. Execute the following command to connect to the Administration Service:

    ```
    <copy>
    CONNECT http://phoenix98251.dev3sub1phx.databasede3phx.oraclevcn.com:9010 DEPLOYMENT NORTH as oggadmin PASSWORD oggadmin
    </copy>
    ```


    You need to establish 2 database connections (`pdbeast` and  `pdbwest`) through the Admin Client in preparation to issue other Oracle GoldenGate commands that affect the database.

    To create database credentials in the Administration Client:

4. Run the following command to add a user `ggeast`:

    ```
    <copy>
    ALTER CREDENTIALSTORE ADD USER ggadmin@orclpdbeast ALIAS ggeast  DOMAIN OracleGoldenGate PASSWORD Welcome1
    </copy>
    ```

5.  To test the database connection, run the following command:
    ```
    <copy>
    DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS ggeast
    </copy>
    ```

6. Run the following command to add a user `ggwest`:

    ```
    <copy>
    ALTER CREDENTIALSTORE ADD USER ggadmin@orclpdbwest ALIAS ggwest  DOMAIN OracleGoldenGate PASSWORD Welcome1
    </copy>
    ```
7.  To test the database connection, run the following command:

    ```
    <copy>
    DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS ggwest
    </copy>
    ```
    You have now successfully created database credentials for the source (`ggeast`) and target (`ggwest`) databases.

  After connecting to the databases, you can enable TRANDATA, add Heartbeat and Checkpoint tables.
